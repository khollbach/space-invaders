## What's this?

This is a [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders) game that [Russ Smith](https://github.com/qqrs) and I worked on at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/).

It's running on a [BBC micro:bit](https://microbit.org/) -- more details [here](https://tech.microbit.org/hardware/#about-the-bbc-microbit). We followed [this guide](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery/microbit/) to get code running on the device, and later switched to [this framework](https://rtic.rs).

It was a ton of fun! Russ taught me all sorts of embedded systems concepts, and I got to use an [oscilloscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscilloscope) for the first time.
